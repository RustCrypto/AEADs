Pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM
[Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)][1] cipher.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## Security Notes

This crate has received one [security audit by NCC Group][2], with no significant
findings. We would like to thank [MobileCoin][3] for funding the audit.

All implementations contained in the crate are designed to execute in constant
time, either by relying on hardware intrinsics (i.e. AES-NI and CLMUL on
x86/x86_64), or using a portable implementation which is only constant time
on processors which implement constant-time multiplication.

It is not suitable for use on processors with a variable-time multiplication
operation (e.g. short circuit on multiply-by-zero / multiply-by-one, such as
certain 32-bit PowerPC CPUs and some non-ARM microcontrollers).
