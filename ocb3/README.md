Pure Rust implementation of the Offset Codebook Mode v3 (OCB3)
[Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)][aead] cipher as described in [RFC7253].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## Example

```rust
use aes::Aes128;
use ocb3::{
    aead::{array::Array, Aead, AeadCore, KeyInit, OsRng},
    consts::U12,
    Ocb3,
};

type Aes128Ocb3 = Ocb3<Aes128, U12>;

let key = Aes128::generate_key().unwrap();
let cipher = Aes128Ocb3::new(&key);
let nonce = Aes128Ocb3::generate_nonce().unwrap();
let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(&nonce, b"plaintext message".as_ref()).unwrap();
let plaintext = cipher.decrypt(&nonce, ciphertext.as_ref()).unwrap();

assert_eq!(&plaintext, b"plaintext message");
```

## Security Notes

No security audits of this crate have ever been performed, and it has not been thoroughly assessed to ensure its operation is constant-time on common CPU architectures.
